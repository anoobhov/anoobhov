### 👋 Greetings!
I'm a **MERN stack developer**,a **DSA & Maths problem-solver** who is sometimes lost in equations & occasionally in infinite loops!

---

### 🧑‍💻 Bits About Me 🔍:
- 🚀 Currently diving into the **MERN stack** — making the web a better place, one React component at a time!
- 🧮 **Maths**: Numbers are my therapy. Calculating probabilities that my code works without bugs: ~0%! 😅
- 🏃 Walking (sometimes running) through random math problems — because it's "prime" time for learning!
- 🧩 Practicing **Data Structures & Algorithms** in C++ — because "array" of hope is better than none. 😉
- 🛠️ **Debugger-in-Chief**: Debugging life, one line at a time. 🐛
---

### 🔧 Tech I'm Mastering:
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React (working on making the web pun-tastic!)
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express (handling requests like a pro)
- **Database:** Mongo and MySQL: (A match made in database heaven)
- **Languages:** C++, JavaScript (writing logic sharper than my sense of humor)
