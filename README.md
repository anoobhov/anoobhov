# 👋 Hey there, I'm Anubhav! 🧑‍💻

> "When life throws you errors, debug them!" 🛠️

Welcome to my GitHub corner! I'm a passionate **MERN stack explorer**, a **DSA problem-solver** in C++, and a math enthusiast who finds beauty in numbers (and sometimes in infinite loops 🤷‍♂️).

---

## 🧑‍💻 About Me:
- 🚀 Currently diving into the **MERN stack** — making the web a better place, one React component at a time!
- 🧮 **Math** lover: Numbers are my therapy. Calculating probabilities that my code works without bugs: ~0%! 😅
- 🧩 Practicing **Data Structures & Algorithms** in C++ — because "array" of hope is better than none. 😉
- 💡 Problem-solving keeps my brain in top-notch "conditionals." 🧠

---

## 🔧 Tech I'm Playing With:
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React (working on making the web pun-tastic!)
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express (handling requests like a pro 🚦)
- **Database:** MongoDB (no "SQL-y" behavior here!)
- **Languages:** C++, JavaScript (writing logic sharper than my sense of humor 🤓)

---

## 📐 When I'm Not Coding:
- 🧩 Solving puzzles that don't crash my browser.
- 📚 Reading about algorithms (because "sorting" out my life is my favorite hobby).
- 🏃 Walking (sometimes running) through random math problems — because it's "prime" time for learning!

---

## 📫 Let’s Connect:
- **GitHub:** You're already here, so don't "fork" around! Check out my repos. 😎
- **Math:** If you're into solving riddles, let's "solve for x" together. 🧮
- **Code:** Collaborations welcome — let's debug life's chaos together. ✨

Feel free to hit the ⭐ button on my repos if they make you smile or debug smarter. Remember: Keep coding, keep solving, and keep "stack"-ing up your skills! 🚀
